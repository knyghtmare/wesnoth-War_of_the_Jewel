First of all, thank you for playing my campaign! I hope you have
enjoyed it! :-)

If you've played it already, you've certainly noticed many strange names
for units, characters and spells, and wondered what on Irdya they meant.
Most of those names were taken from Ancient Egyptian History and mythology,
and some I've created based on Ancient Egyptian words. I'm no Egyptologist, of course,
and so I may have mistaken the meaning and writing of a few words; if you who are
reading this is an Egyptologist, then please, forgive any mistakes I may have commited. :-)

Now, to the point: below you have a small golossary on the 'strange words' in
War of the Jewel, as well as their meanings.


- A'aneb - Highest level of a Maat'Karian swordsman; a mix of
A'a, which means 'great', and Neb, 'lord'


- A'anebet - The highest title held by Atenak, it comes from A'a, 'great', and
nebet, 'lady'

known as Amenhotep IV; Akhenaten means 'effective of Aten'; Aten is the sun god

- Amunet - That's the name of Akhen's mother; it's the female form of Amun, one of the
gods of the Egyptian pantheon, often associated with Ra.


- Apep Wenen - One of the two Supreme Umbra Spells; wenen means 'darkness'; Apep is
the god of darkness and chaos, known to the Greeks as Apophis. Hence, Apep Wenen
should mean Darkness of Apep.

the teleport technique, her name comes from Meretseger, which is the name of both
a goddess and a queen from the New Kingdom period.

evil spirits of Greek mythology who dwell in the Underworld.

which means 'red desert' - which may remind you of the new name Stygia suggested
for the Silent Desert: Crimson Wasteland.

a reference to Memnon's incredible power.

the name of Pharaoh Djoser's councillor, who was also a priest of Ra.


- Imey'er - Actually it should be Imey'er-mesha, which means 'general', but I had a guess
that this would be too complicated a name for most people, so I left it as Imey'er ;-P


- Khem - Atseger's home town, it literally means 'black'.


- Khemet - One of Mahyus' special abilities; Khemet means 'black land', and was the
name the Ancient Egyptians gave their own land. Here, I use it as 'black realm',
in reference to the Umbra Arts.

means 'black', which fits his evil character.

is also the name of a princess, one of Pharaoh Akhenaten's daughters.
 

- Merwe - I created this name from merwet, which means 'love'. It's a perfect name for
her, I think: not only is it easy to memorize, but it also fits her loving
personality (you may say that she's aggressive on Nyx, but it's only because she
likes Akhen and is jealous of the vampiress ;-) )


- Mewates - One of Maat'Kare's most important families and leading seafarers; it comes from
mew, which means 'water'.


- Migdol - The name of the Maat'Karian armed outposts; it's actually a hebrew word that means
'tower'; I confess that there was an Age of Mythology influence here, since the Egyptian
civilization in that game uses Migdols as fortresses. I also liked the name, so... ;-)

which means 'fire'.

just as it's explained in-game, from tie=five, seba=star and hed=to punish.


- Uranometria - Merwe's special ability which makes her fight better under starlight.
It's the name of a star atlas authored by the German celestial cartographer Johann Bayer;
Uranometria is an amalgam of Uranos (heaven) and Metria (to measure), thus it means
