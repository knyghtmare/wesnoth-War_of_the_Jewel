    description= _ "Maat'Karian soldiers are famed for their defensive power: wearing heavy armour that covers nearly the entirety of their bodies, they are highly resistant to most kinds of attack. Nevertheless, this poses two problems for their military: firstly, they can't afford producing electrum armour for many soldiers; and second, even if they could, not all would have the necessary height, strength and stamina to efficiently fight while donning them. It was Erakyn, a famous general of Maat'Kare's third generation, who solved both problems by creating a new unit which donnned a new type of armour, one that didn't protect the soldier as the one donned by the Sefet did; but which was lighter and less expensive, and made of electrum as well. This new unit was given long spears, which was a cheaper and more accessible weapon to people. These units were seldom sent to fight on pitched battles, but they became an important part of Maat'Kare's defence, for they are always employed as guards and patrollers in towns, villages and frontier outposts."
