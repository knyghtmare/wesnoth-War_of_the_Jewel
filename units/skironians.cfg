    description= _ "The Skironians are a human civilization that have settled in the distant continent of Argea centuries before the Founding of Wesnoth. Their ancestors were, in their majority, ancient Aragwaithi who left the city of Maat'Kare for not being willing to embrace the developing Maat'Karian culture in detriment of their own ancestors' traditions.
	
Their first years in Argea were hard, and they were nearly destroyed by the land's older inhabitants, the orcs, the fauns and the centaurs. Their salvation came when they found a chain of islands on the eastern coast; taking advantage of their neighbours' lack of ships, they made themselves unreachable in those islands, at the same time honing their own sailing skills. When they were strong and numerous again, they launched many campaigns on coastal tribes, reclaiming many lands and building more cities.
	
When most of Eastern Argea was under human control, the king of the city of Aeria, Alexias, united his and all other cities into a single empire, which he called Skiron after the name of the first of those islands to be settled. Once united, the Argean humans built a thriving nation and a solid culture, which rivalled Maat'Kare itself.

However, the control of so many lands by a single aristocracy formed an increasingly power-hungry elite. After a period of unstoppable growth, the empire entered an age of gradual social degradation, which culminated with the army growing weaker, and with the loss of many lands to orcs and minotaurs.

In this scenario of decay and social neglect, a leader rose amongst the people with the courage and the power to defy the emperor. His name was Aegaion, and he wielded fabulous power over life and death which the Skironians, who did not practice magic, believed to be unrivalled even by that of the Maat'Karians. Aegaion harnessed the population's revolt into a army bent on toppling the Imperial Dinasty, thus starting a brutal civil war.

But the civilians, as angry and numerous as they were, could not match the superior military might of Emperor Amphyon's armies. Seeing his forces being crushed in the hundreds, Aegaion taught his most loyal followers some of his own powers; and together, they raised a vast army of undead, before which the Imperial forces fell in the thousands. After a reign of a thousand years, Skiron's dinasty fell to the hands of Aegaion, who crowned himself the new emperor and gave his closest followers administrative powers, naming them Lich-Lords.

The new Skiron quickly became a juggernaut like Argea had never seen, retaking the lost lands and expanding the empire's borders to unprecedented extent; the centaurs were the worst victims of this expansion, as they were driven to near-extinction. Poverty was greatly diminished as well, and the people hailed Aegaion as their 'Dark Saint'.

But this power came at a cost. Albeit stronger and richer, Skiron became a land of little freedom; twisted by the dark powers learned from Aegaion, most Lich-Lords became tyrants; some were even known to use their own subjects for dark experiments, and a few turned their own fiefs' entire population into undead. Such was the price Skiron paid to become powerful again."
