Well, amidst this jungle lies the entrance to a deep network of tunnels known as the Caves of the Asherah, or Caves of Light. Even our greatest sages know very little about it, because of all Chomi scouts sent there, none returned. It is known, however, thanks to old Babalawo Kayode, that there is a fearsome power lying on those depths, a power that made even Kayode himself quake in fear, or so the tale claims."
