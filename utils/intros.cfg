She too felt tenser as they neared the end of that war, but for a different reason: she feared the outcome of that final battle. Not that she didn't trust Akhen; she simply hadn't forgotten how Menon had, almost single-handedly, devastated Jevyan's armada and Stygia's legion, and she just couldn't bear the thought of her Akhen facing that monster alone..."

It didn't matter to neither that their ancestors had been mortal enemies, or that they'd never be able to have children, or even that she was twice his age; all that mattered was that, against all odds, they loved each other."
